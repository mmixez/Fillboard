                        <p5>FillBoard is a very young startup founded in the heart of technology and innovation - the silicon valley. It was founded by 4 motivated entrepreneurs/developers with the goal of starting a project that helps people to find activities and friends in a more disconnected world than ever.<p5><br><br>

                            Getting together with friends and acquaintances is nowadays mostly done by the use of social media. Organizing meetings with friends is usually done via group chats or by phone calls. If you are interested in a certain topic there is the possibility to join facebook groups, telegram channels or reddit categories. There are already a lot of possibilities to get together with people but itâ€™s a misuse of the technology's real purpose. With FillBoard there is the opportunity to provide information for events and meetings more user friendly and faster.
